# Organize-files

This is a Python script that helps organize cluttered files within a folder into folders named as MM_YYYY, and within each folder, there will be a subfolder for each file type.

## Initial Requirements

- Two folders:
  - The source folder containing the cluttered files that you want to organize.
  - The destination folder where you want the organized files to be placed.

- Python Installed:
  - Install Python from the official Python website at python.org.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.

2. Run the script `Organize.py` using Python.

3. When prompted by the program, enter the path for the source folder containing the cluttered files.

4. Next, enter the path for the destination folder where you want the organized files to be placed.

5. The script will organize the files based on their modified date and file types into separate folders with the format MM_YYYY.

6. (Optional) To perform an additional check, run the script `check.py`.

7. When prompted by the program, enter the same source and destination folder paths as entered before.

8. The check script will indicate the percentage of files that are not being copied to the destination folder. This helps to ensure the accuracy of the file organization process.
